== 3.1.0 2010-12-17
* Add back in rake test tasks (Toby Cabot)
* Add support for multiple string composite keys (wouter)
* Remove support for find('3,3').  Instead use find([3,3])


== 3.0.9 2010-12-04
* Fix up support for composite key fixtures.


== 3.0.8 2010-12-04
* Fix for translation issue in unique validation.  Thanks to Daniel Berger for the patch.
* Fix to support child classes of composite primary key models


== 3.0.7 2010-11-29
* Fix has and belongs to many associations implementation.


== 3.0.6 2010-11-29  (yanked)
* Add full support for has and belongs to many associations.


== 3.0.5 2010-11-28 (yanked)
* Apply patch from Marian Rudzynski for fixing up attribute_methods/primary_key
* Apply patch from Toby Cabot to fix up various sqlite3 issues
* Add partial support for has and belongs to many associations.  Currently a cpk model
  can have a habtm, but a normal model cannot have a habtm to a cpk model (its actually
  not too hard to add, but one step at a time...)


== 3.0.4 2010-11-21
* Support deleting records when dependent is set to :delete_all
* Switch the method #id to return a CompositeKeys instance (thus going back to how
  this was done in previous CPK versions)


== 3.0.3 2010-11-19
* Support ActiveRecord 3.0.3 and Arel 2+
* Require ActiveRecord 3.0.3 as minimum dependency
* Fix double quoting issue with table names - thanks to Kevin Motschiedler for a patch.
* Fix SQLiteAdapter class inheritance issue - thanks to Brandon Hauff for a patch.


== 3.0.1.b3 2010-11-07

* Fix bug in joining to :has_one association
* Added support for Model.find(:last)
* Added support for finding via associations with
  limited ids.  For example find(:include => :foo, :limit => 1)

== 3.0.1.b2 2010-11-06

* Port to Rails 3.0 and Ruby 1.9.2

* Backwards compatability issues
  + You can no longer define a composite primary key with a single field.  If you
    try, your model will just default to a standard active record model.  Removing
    this corner case simplified the code.
  + Removed CompositePrimaryKeys::CompositeKeys.  This was done so that the #to_s
    method on composite ids, such as [1,2], returns "[1, 2]".  This in turns
    reduces the amount of core Rails code that needs to be overridden.
  + Setting attribute values by string is no longer supported. For example, this
    no longer works:
      my_record[[:main_id, :secondary_id]] = '1,2'
    Instead, do  this:
      my_record[[:main_id, :secondary_id]] = [1,2]
    Once again, this was done to reduce the amount of overridden Rails code
  + At the moment, complex finds with nested arrays do not work.  For example
    find([[1,2], [3,4]))
  + Count methods no longer work.  For example, Tariff.count(:include => :product_tariffs)
    in the TestAssociations#test_count test returns an error.  This is because Rails 3.0
    uses Arel to perform such calculations, and its not obvious (at least to me) how to
    hook into this new mechanism to support tables with composite keys.
  + The TestPolymorphic#test_polymorphic_has_many_through is currently failing, but this
    looks like an ActiveRecord 3.0 bug to me.
